# This is the main configuration file for the PaleBalloons plugin.
# Here you can configure database settings and balloon physics.
#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT:
# - After modifying this file, use /balloons reload
# - Make sure to backup this file before making changes
# - Invalid configurations may prevent the plugin from loading
#

database:
  # Database driver: h2 or mysql
  # h2 = Local file database (recommended for small servers)
  # mysql = Remote MySQL database (recommended for large networks)
  driver: h2

  # MySQL settings (only used if driver is 'mysql')
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  name: balloons
  user: root
  password: ""

# Balloon Physics Settings
# These values control how balloons move and behave
physics:
  # Base height of the balloon above the player (in blocks)
  balloon-height: 2.5

  # Minimum movement required to be considered "moving" (in blocks)
  # Lower values = more sensitive to small movements
  idle-threshold: 0.1

  # Speed of the bobbing animation (higher = faster bobbing)
  bob-speed: 2.0

  # Speed of the swaying animation (higher = faster swaying)
  sway-speed: 1.5

  # How much the balloon bobs up and down (in blocks)
  bob-amplitude: 0.15

  # How much the balloon sways side to side (in blocks)
  sway-amplitude: 0.1

  # Distance behind the player the balloon follows (in blocks)
  follow-distance: 1.0

  # Maximum distance before balloon teleports to player (in blocks)
  # Prevents balloons from getting stuck too far away
  max-distance: 5.0

  # Height of the lead anchor relative to the armor stand base (in blocks)
  # This should match where the helmet/head is positioned on the armor stand
  # For normal armor stands, the head is approximately 1.5 blocks above the base
  # Adjust this if you see a gap between the lead and the balloon
  lead-anchor-height: 1.5

  # Fine-tune offset for the lead anchor (in blocks)
  # Positive values move the anchor up, negative values move it down
  lead-anchor-offset: 0.0

  # Cleanup radius for old leads and hitches (in blocks)
  cleanup-radius: 10.0

  # How fast the balloon catches up to the player (0.0 - 1.0)
  # Higher = faster catch-up, Lower = smoother following
  catch-up-speed: 0.3

  # Maximum catch-up speed per tick (in blocks)
  max-catch-up-speed: 0.5

  # Tilt angle multiplier for balloon rotation (degrees per block of movement)
  tilt-multiplier: 30.0

  # Additional tilt when swaying (degrees)
  sway-tilt-multiplier: 15.0

  # Maximum idle time to reach full animation (in seconds)
  max-idle-time: 2.0

  # How often the balloon updates (in ticks, 20 ticks = 1 second)
  # Lower = smoother animation, Higher = better performance
  # Recommended: 1 (every tick) for smooth animations
  update-interval: 1

# Balloon Entity Settings
entity:
  # Startup delay before cleaning orphaned entities (in ticks)
  # Gives time for all players to load before cleanup
  cleanup-startup-delay: 40

  # Delay before re-equipping balloon after teleport (in ticks)
  respawn-delay: 3

# DO NOT TOUCH THIS!
config-version: 1
